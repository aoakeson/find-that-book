| Tuning | in_sample: Every row was run while the research rules were designed and tuned (research/05-08, the plan 04 fixes, the plan 06 v3 ablations replayed this set on cached live responses). in_hard_set marks the 30 queries that are also in the research hard set (research/07-fix-misses/hard.jsonl, 46 rows), which was in-sample too. Numbers on this set measure regressions and fidelity to the prototype, not generalization. |

## Headline

| Metric | Value | Definition |
|---|---|---|
| **Match precision** | **48/48 = 1.000** | `match` rows whose top-1 is right (and the row allows match) |
| Top-1 | 57/57 = 1.000 | answerable rows, first shown candidate acceptable |
| Top-5 | 57/57 = 1.000 | answerable rows, an acceptable candidate in the first five |
| Status accuracy | 60/60 = 1.000 | outcome in the row's accepted statuses (incl. `rejected` = validation 400) |
| Coverage (auto-accept) | 48/57 = .842 | answerable rows returned as `match` |
| False matches on no-answer rows | 0 of 3 | any `match` where no book is right |
| Severe matches | 0 | wrong or false `match` (battle severe; a duplicate record of the right book is not counted) |
| Duplicate-record matches | 0 | `match` on another record of the intended book (battle major) |
| Errors | 0 | the search threw (catalog failure, timeout, crash) |

## Judge

Off in this run (n/a).

## Explanations

- Source mix (shown candidates): llm 0, template 284 (.000 llm)
- Grounding rejections (template shown although the explain call succeeded): 0
- Rows with explanation_fallback (explain call failed/unavailable): 57

## Degraded

- Degraded rate: 57/59 = .966
  - of which 57 only because of this run's settings (LLM off / --explain template / hypothesis replay: ai_not_configured, explanation_fallback)
- Rows with a provider error (timeout / 5xx / 429 on interpret or explain; not our budget): 0/59 = .000
- explanation_fallback: 57
- Interpretation source: llm 59

## Open Library calls

- Logical calls per query: mean 1.46, max 4, at budget 0 (budget: 5 logical calls)
- Cache hits: 6/86 = .070
- HTTP attempts: 80 total, mean 1.36 per query; slow-empty re-queries 0
- Outcomes: ok 86
- Steps: broad 59, hypothesis 14, author_works 6, any_of 3, original_title 1, person 1, person_fallback 1, person_fallback_any 1

## LLM usage and cost

| Operation | calls | cache hits | statuses | input tok | output tok |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| explain | 57 | 0 | not_configured 57 | n/a | n/a |
| interpret | 59 | 0 | ok 59 | 30984 | 5494 |

- Paid LLM calls (not cache hits, incl. judge): 59
- Estimated cost (IAiPricing, paid-tier list prices): $0.02303 for 59 searches = **$0.390342 per 1,000 searches**

## Misses (0)

None.

## Prototype reference (not this build)

**Reference only: Python prototype numbers from the research phase, NOT measured by this build.** They were produced on golden v1 (none-04 scored as a 200 `none`; v2 expects a 400, same 60-row denominator) by research/12 `golden_v3.py` replaying research/07's cached live responses, with LLM-on rows using cached gpt-4.1-mini prompt-v1 hypotheses (so plan 06 fix 6 could not fire). Rows are in-sample: the rules were tuned on them.

| Prototype arm (source) | top-1 / top-5 (57) | status (60) | `match` n @ precision |
|---|---|---|---|
| v3, LLM on (plan 06) | .982 / 1.000 | .983 | 45 @ 1.000 |
| v3, LLM off (plan 06) | .982 / 1.000 | .933 | 39 @ 1.000 |
| 07 code fixes, LLM on, live (plan 04) | .947 / .982 | .983 | 44 @ 1.000 |
| 07 code fixes, LLM off, live (plan 04) | .912 / .982 | .950 | 39 @ .974 |
| raw Open Library order (plan 03 arm A) | 45/57 (.79) / 48/57 (.84) | 48/60 (.80) | 53 @ .74 |
| Target set for the C# pipeline (plan 03) | ≥ .91 / ≥ .95 | ≥ .92 | precision ≥ .97 |

Noise: one golden query = 1.8 points of top-1.

Parse stability and retrieval variability are measured by the `stability` command (separate report).
